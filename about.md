Hello! My name is BenRifkah Bergsten-Buret, or Ben for short. I live in Seattle Washington and have lived in the Pacific Northwest for most of my life.

Since 2005 I've supported the [University of Washington's Clinical Trials Center](https://roc.uwctc.org/) as the data coordinating center of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium, one of the world's largest emergency medicine research initiatives. Our small team continues to perform ground breaking research and developing new tools to support it.

I'm supporting a collection of web applications written in Perl, JavaScript, jQuery, Prototype.js, HTML::Mason, Moose, PHP, Laravel and Bootstrap. I'm actively developing platform and deployment tools to handle the repetitive tasks and keep our team small.

I've handled server installs, upgrades, migrations, failures and decommissions. I'm implementing systems compliant with federal HIPAA, 21 CFR 11 electronic signature regulations. I'm monitoring FDA UDI labeling requirements.

Through all of this I completed training and served as a parenting instructor at [Break Through Learning Center](https://btlconline.com/). I also volunteer as a web administrator and hour of code facilitator for my son's elementary school. I assisted the [International RRP ISA Center](http://rrpwebsite.org/) as a client liaison through their last website redesign.

If your team is about making a difference in the world, in any business sector, [I'd love to hear from you](http://goo.gl/forms/OJSoCD6WrvfH11p33).
